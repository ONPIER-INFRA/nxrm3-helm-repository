# ⚠️ Archive Notice

As of February 9, 2024, we now provide one [HA/Resiliency Helm Chart](https://github.com/sonatype/nxrm3-ha-repository/tree/main/nxrm-ha) that supports both high availability and resilient deployments in AWS, Azure, or on-premises in a Kubernetes cluster. This is our only supported Helm chart for deploying Sonatype Nexus Repository; it requires a PostgreSQL database and a Pro license. 

# Helm Chart Instructions

See the [HA/Resiliency Helm Chart in GitHub](https://github.com/sonatype/nxrm3-ha-repository/tree/main/nxrm-ha) for details on the new combined Helm chart.
